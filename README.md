# 42_CPP02
 This project consists of implementing a C++ class following the canonical form of Coplien, which includes a default constructor, copy constructor, assignment operator, and destructor. The goal is to create a Fixed class representing fixed-point numbers, with a fixed precision of 8 bits for the fractional part.
